## Snake Game
This project is a classic Snake game developed in Java as part of the TDT4100 Object-Oriented Programming course. The player controls a snake using the keys A, S, W, and D. The snake grows longer each time it eats an apple, making the game progressively harder. The goal is to grow the snake as much as possible without crashing into the walls or the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the edges of the game board.
